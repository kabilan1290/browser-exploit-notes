Basics:

Client-server model - 1970s ==> Request-Response

Same Origin Policy ==> SOP - restrict resources from one origin interacting with other origins.

SOP intially only for external resources and the extended to access for local files and browser related resources.

Markup - a way of specifying how to display content in web browser.

SGML(Standard generalized markup language) ==> HTML & XML

VBscript ==> Supports only in microsoft browser.

Render Engines:

Webkit ==> Apple,Chrome(Past)

Trident/Mshtml ==>  Microsoft

Gecko ==> Firefox/Mozilla

Pestro ==>Opera,Droppped in 2013

Blink ==> Google(Forked webkit to create blink)

Web storage ==> Referred to as DOM storage

Two types of cookies ==> local storage and session based

Local storage presists over multiple visits from the user.

Session storage is only available in the tab that created it.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing:

CORS - Method to ignore SOP and access resources from any origin.

Web Workers - Web Workers are a simple means for web content to run scripts in background threads. The worker thread can perform tasks without interfering with the user interface. 

HTTP Headers - Provides a natural mechanism for the server to instruct the browser to introduce additional security controls.

Content Security Policy(CSP) ==> CSP has been designed to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities.Restriction on how scripts can be loaded.

Secure Cookie Flag - Historically, cookies were sent over both HTTP and HTTPS without discriminating between the two origins.
SCP instructs the browser to never send the cookie over any unsecured channel.

HttpOnly cookie flag - The HttpOnly flag instructs the browser to disallow access to the cookie content from any scripts.

Strict-Transport-Security - This HTTP header instructs the browser that communication to the website
must occur over a valid HTTPS tunnel. It will not be possible for the user to
accept any HTTPS errors and proceed over an insecure connection.

Robustness Principle of internet - Robustness Principle or postel law states that the TCP implementations should be conservative in what they do(send) and liberal in what they accept from others.
